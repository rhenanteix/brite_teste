Frontend Hiring Project
Thank you for taking time to do our frontend coding test. It is inspired by a real world problem we faced and includes two parts:

The coding test
A few followup questions
Problem
BriteCore's clients use our platform to manage all aspects of their business, including tracking open claims, sending out monthly bills and running annual reports.

As a result, many of our pages are data heavy, and we often use a data table component for display and modifying this information. A data table component is similar to a classic HTML table, but includes other features.

A component to display this data should include the following functionality:

Displaying data in sortable columns
Filtering data based on different parameters
Searching data
Actions that can be taken on each data item, or applied to all items in the table.
Effective display and user experience across resolutions
The Coding Test
We would like you to create you own data table component. For this test, download the data in CSV format to your own computer. This is mock payment data for one of our products. This data includes a description field, which the user will need to be able to customize.

User Stories
As a payment supervisor, I would like to be able to view recent payments logged in the system, so that I can understand all the transactions that have been made.

As a payment supervisor, I would like to be able to edit the descriptions of recent payments easily, so that others can clearly understand why a payment was made.

Requirements
Take as much or as little time as you would like to complete the following requirements:

Satisfy the user stories outlined above.
Include tests for your component.
Your solution must use Vue.js.
Your solution must use Vuex to save data to the backend persistence store of your choice. Common choices are Firebase or Amplify/DynamodDB.
The data table component you create should be your own, and not one provided by a UI pattern library.
As you'll be working alongside a design team regularly, demonstrating a level of visual polish and UX skill is necessary.
Deliverables
One of the major goals in this project is to see how you fill in ambiguities in your own creative way. There is no such thing as a perfect project here, just interpretations of the instructions above, so be creative in your approach.

In order to move your application forward, deliverables will include:

A deployed version of your project.

A GitHub or GitLab repo containing your project. Your repo must contain these four things:

A README that explains your approach and deployment method. It must also answer these questions:

How long did you spend on the test? Would you do anything differently if you had more time?
In what ways would you adapt your component so that it could be used in many different scenarios where a data table is required?
What CSS property did you recently learn about that helped you on a project?
What is your favorite modern Javascript feature? Why?
What is your favorite third-party Vue.js library? Why?
Your code solution to this test.

The Javascript file called quiz.js that contains what you used to solve the debugging quiz.

A JSON file called description.json that describes you.

Adding of these items to your resume's cover letter:

The link to the GitHub or GitLab repo that lists this project.
The link to the deployed version of your project.
